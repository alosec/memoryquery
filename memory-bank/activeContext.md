# Active Context

## Current Status: Sync Daemon First Pass Complete, Testing Phase Next ‚ú®

The simple-memory-mcp project has successfully implemented both the complete MCP server AND the first working version of the sync daemon following proven cafe-db-sync patterns. The sync daemon is processing JSONL files and successfully populating the database. Next phase focuses on comprehensive testing and refinement.

## Project Genesis (August 8, 2025)

### Why Start Fresh?
- **Technical Debt Elimination**: Previous repositories had accumulated complexity and pipeline overhead
- **Unified Architecture**: MCP tools and sync daemon should be one coherent package
- **Clean Git History**: Cannot import messy history from existing repositories
- **Focused Scope**: Build exactly what's needed without extra complexity

### Core Vision
**One-Command Install:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.simple-memory.com | bash
# ‚úÖ MCP server installed and registered
# ‚úÖ Sync daemon configured and running
# ‚úÖ All services coordinated
# ‚úÖ Ready to use immediately
```

## Current Focus: Foundation Architecture (August 8, 2025)

### Design Principles
1. **Installation-Centric**: User experience starts with install, everything flows from there
2. **Service Coordination**: Components designed to work together, not separately
3. **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized code without legacy complexity
4. **Zero Technical Debt**: Fresh start with modern best practices
5. **Focused Functionality**: Build what's needed, skip unnecessary features

## Active Development Goals

### ‚úÖ Completed Milestones (August 8, 2025)
1. **‚úÖ Foundation Setup**: Complete memory bank and project structure established
2. **‚úÖ MCP Server**: All 8 tools implemented with modular architecture
3. **‚úÖ Package Definition**: Working package.json with dependencies and build system
4. **‚úÖ CLI Interface**: Service management commands functional

## üéØ Strategic North Star: Memory MCP Server Focus

### Clear Mission Scope
**Primary Goal**: Create a robust, production-ready MCP server for Claude Code conversation history access. The sync daemon integration is specifically scoped to **support the MCP server functionality** - not as a general-purpose sync system.

**Strategic Focus**:
- **MCP Server**: The core product - conversation history access via MCP protocol
- **Sync Daemon**: Supporting component to ensure MCP server has real-time data access
- **Unified Package**: Install and manage both as coherent system focused on memory access

**Not in Scope**: General sync engines, complex multi-database systems, or pipeline transformations beyond what's needed for MCP functionality.

### üéØ Current Development Focus (August 8, 2025)
1. **‚úÖ Sync Daemon First Pass**: Complete Watch-Transform-Execute pipeline implemented following cafe-db-sync patterns
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Phase Results**: Executed test suite - discovered fundamental design flaws requiring test redesign
3. **üìã Next: Testing Apparatus Redesign**: Refine tests to validate real data sync instead of synthetic test files
4. **üìã Future: Installation Script**: Setup automation prioritizing MCP registration and functionality

**Immediate Priority**: Redesign test suite to validate real Claude Code conversation sync (see planning/testing-redesign-feedback.md)

### Integration Strategy for Sync Daemon
- **Purpose**: Ensure MCP server has fresh conversation data from Claude Code JSONL files
- **Scope**: Parse Claude Code format, update database, maintain sync health
- **Integration**: Coordinate as supporting service, not equal-priority component
- **Success Metric**: MCP tools return current conversation data without manual intervention

### Reference Implementation Strategy
- **Study Working Sync**: Extract core sync logic from `/home/alex/code/cafe/cafe-db-sync` (without importing technical debt)
- **Enhance MCP Tools**: Build on proven MCP server patterns from `claude-code-memory-mcp`
- **Modern Packaging**: Apply current software packaging practices from scratch

## Success Metrics

### ‚úÖ Achieved
- **‚úÖ Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable modular architecture implemented
- **‚úÖ Development Experience**: TypeScript build, CLI interface, proper package structure
- **‚úÖ MCP Functionality**: All 8 tools working with enhanced features
- **‚úÖ Architecture Foundation**: Clean separation enabling easy sync daemon integration

### üéØ Next Targets
- **Install Experience**: Single command creates fully working system  
- **Service Reliability**: Both MCP and sync work together without manual intervention
- **User Adoption**: Package that developers actually want to install and use
- **Cross-Tool Support**: Cline and Claude Desktop integration

## Development Philosophy
**"Build it Right from Day 1"**: This project prioritizes doing things properly over speed. The goal is a solid package that represents the Claude Code memory tools ecosystem well.

Every architectural decision should be made through the lens of: "Is this the right way to solve this problem?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt Identified (December 2024)

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **Hardcoded Paths**: Some paths still reference original Claude Code DB instead of simple-memory DB
   - Need systematic review of all database path references
   - Ensure consistent use of `SIMPLE_MEMORY_DB_PATH` environment variable
   
2. **TODO Comments**: Unresolved TODO comments throughout codebase need tracking
   - Create issue tracker or resolve inline
   - Priority assessment for each TODO item

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Status Command Design Failure (August 2025)

**Problem**: The `npm run status` command produces enormous log outputs (80k+ lines) instead of simple status information.

**Root Cause**: Status command triggers the sync daemon's internal operations which cause massive log generation:
1. `getSyncDaemonStatus()` calls `getRecentSyncLatency()` which reads transaction logs
2. Reading logs triggers sync daemon activity 
3. Sync daemon produces continuous output during status check
4. Status becomes unusable for quick checks

**Requirements for Fix**:
- Status command must return deterministic, FAST response
- Should show: sync daemon running/stopped, latency metrics, watcher status
- Must NOT trigger any sync operations or log generation
- Output should be <10 lines, complete in <1 second

**Impact**: Status command is unusable for testing, monitoring, or quick checks. Critical blocker for test suite execution.
   
3. **Type Safety**: Multiple `any` types compromise TypeScript benefits
   - Audit all `any` usage in CLI, MCP server, and sync daemon
   - Define proper interfaces for server instances, config objects, promises
   
4. **Configuration Consolidation**: Environment variable handling scattered
   - Centralize config management in dedicated module
   - Consistent defaults and validation across all components
   - Single source of truth for paths, timeouts, and service settings

### Testing Implementation Complete (December 2024)
- **‚úÖ Test Suite Created**: 8 non-interactive test scripts implemented in `/test/`
- **‚úÖ Core Metrics Covered**: Sync latency (P50/P95), data integrity, error handling
- **‚úÖ LLM-Friendly Design**: Parseable output with clear exit codes
- **‚úÖ Package.json Updated**: Test commands integrated (`npm test`, category-specific)

### Next Phase: Test Execution and Validation
**Outside Current Session Scope:**
1. **Run Tests**: Execute suite to discover actual issues
2. **Validate Quality**: Ensure tests detect real problems with helpful debug output
3. **Fix Issues**: Address bugs revealed by testing
4. **Refine Tests**: Adjust based on real-world performance

**Critical Validation Points:**
- Do tests actually detect sync failures?
- Are latency measurements accurate?
- Is debug output helpful for troubleshooting?
- Do tests work on fresh installations?

The foundation is built - next step is iterative refinement through actual execution.
