# Active Context

## Current Status: Sync Daemon First Pass Complete, Testing Phase Next ‚ú®

The simple-memory-mcp project has successfully implemented both the complete MCP server AND the first working version of the sync daemon following proven cafe-db-sync patterns. The sync daemon is processing JSONL files and successfully populating the database. Next phase focuses on comprehensive testing and refinement.

## Project Genesis (August 8, 2025)

### Why Start Fresh?
- **Technical Debt Elimination**: Previous repositories had accumulated complexity and pipeline overhead
- **Unified Architecture**: MCP tools and sync daemon should be one coherent package
- **Clean Git History**: Cannot import messy history from existing repositories
- **Focused Scope**: Build exactly what's needed without extra complexity

### Core Vision
**One-Command Install:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.simple-memory.com | bash
# ‚úÖ MCP server installed and registered
# ‚úÖ Sync daemon configured and running
# ‚úÖ All services coordinated
# ‚úÖ Ready to use immediately
```

## Current Focus: Foundation Architecture (August 8, 2025)

3. **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized code without legacy complexity
4. **Zero Technical Debt**: Fresh start with modern best practices
5. **Focused Functionality**: Build what's needed, skip unnecessary features

## Active Development Goals

### ‚úÖ Completed Milestones (August 8, 2025)
1. **‚úÖ Foundation Setup**: Complete memory bank and project structure established
2. **‚úÖ MCP Server**: All 8 tools implemented with modular architecture
3. **‚úÖ Package Definition**: Working package.json with dependencies and build system
4. **‚úÖ CLI Interface**: Service management commands functional

## üéØ Strategic North Star: Memory MCP Server Focus

### Clear Mission Scope
**Primary Goal**: Create a robust, production-ready MCP server for Claude Code conversation history access. The sync daemon integration is specifically scoped to **support the MCP server functionality** - not as a general-purpose sync system.

**Strategic Focus**:
- **MCP Server**: The core product - conversation history access via MCP protocol
- **Sync Daemon**: Supporting component to ensure MCP server has real-time data access
- **Unified Package**: Install and manage both as coherent system focused on memory access

**Not in Scope**: General sync engines, complex multi-database systems, or pipeline transformations beyond what's needed for MCP functionality.

### üéØ Current Development Focus (August 8, 2025)
1. **‚úÖ Sync Daemon First Pass**: Complete Watch-Transform-Execute pipeline implemented following cafe-db-sync patterns
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Phase Results**: Executed test suite - discovered fundamental design flaws requiring test redesign
3. **üìã Next: Testing Apparatus Redesign**: Refine tests to validate real data sync instead of synthetic test files
4. **üìã Future: Installation Script**: Setup automation prioritizing MCP registration and functionality

**Immediate Priority**: Redesign test suite to validate real Claude Code conversation sync (see planning/testing-redesign-feedback.md)

### Integration Strategy for Sync Daemon
- **Purpose**: Ensure MCP server has fresh conversation data from Claude Code JSONL files
- **Scope**: Parse Claude Code format, update database, maintain sync health
- **Integration**: Coordinate as supporting service, not equal-priority component
- **Success Metric**: MCP tools return current conversation data without manual intervention

### Reference Implementation Strategy
- **Study Working Sync**: Extract core sync logic from `/home/alex/code/cafe/cafe-db-sync` (without importing technical debt)
- **Enhance MCP Tools**: Build on proven MCP server patterns from `claude-code-memory-mcp`
- **Modern Packaging**: Apply current software packaging practices from scratch

## Success Metrics

### ‚úÖ Achieved
- **‚úÖ Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable modular architecture implemented
- **‚úÖ Development Experience**: TypeScript build, CLI interface, proper package structure
- **‚úÖ MCP Functionality**: All 8 tools working with enhanced features
- **‚úÖ Architecture Foundation**: Clean separation enabling easy sync daemon integration

### üéØ Next Targets
- **Install Experience**: Single command creates fully working system  
- **Service Reliability**: Both MCP and sync work together without manual intervention
- **User Adoption**: Package that developers actually want to install and use
- **Cross-Tool Support**: Cline and Claude Desktop integration

## Development Philosophy
**"Build it Right from Day 1"**: This project prioritizes doing things properly over speed. The goal is a solid package that represents the Claude Code memory tools ecosystem well.

Every architectural decision should be made through the lens of: "Is this the right way to solve this problem?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt Identified (December 2024)

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **Hardcoded Paths**: Some paths still reference original Claude Code DB instead of simple-memory DB
   - Need systematic review of all database path references
   - Ensure consistent use of `SIMPLE_MEMORY_DB_PATH` environment variable
   
2. **TODO Comments**: Unresolved TODO comments throughout codebase need tracking
   - Create issue tracker or resolve inline
   - Priority assessment for each TODO item

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Non-Interactive Command Requirement (August 2025)

**Problem**: Multiple development and CLI commands hang or produce interactive behaviors that block testing and automation.

**Requirements for ALL Commands**:
- **Status command**: ‚úÖ FIXED - `npm run status` now provides clean output in <5 seconds  
- **Test Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING - `npm run test:status` provides clean output
- **Start command**: ‚ùå STILL INTERACTIVE - `npm start -- --sync-only` captures attention and blocks shell
- **All CLI scripts**: Must be completely non-interactive
- **Background processes**: Must detach properly and not block shell
- **Error handling**: Must exit cleanly with proper codes, no hanging

**Specific Issues Identified**:
1. ‚úÖ `npm run status` - FIXED via CLI refactoring to external validation pattern
2. ‚ùå `npm start` - Still captures attention, displays "Press Ctrl+C to stop" message
3. ‚ùå `npm run dev:sync` - Still captures attention even with & background operator
4. ‚úÖ Package.json scripts - Fixed daemon.ts reference to index.ts
5. ‚ùå All start/dev commands need proper daemon/background mode for non-interactive operation

**Impact**: Cannot reliably run services in automated environments. Critical for CI/CD and testing workflows.

**Solution Required**: Start command needs `--daemon` or `--background` flag to detach from shell properly.

**Infrastructure Fix Complete (August 2025)**:
- ‚úÖ **CLI Commands Fixed**: Status command now <5 seconds, daemon mode working, PID file management
- ‚úÖ **Process Management**: Clean start/stop/restart with proper background mode support
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Isolation**: CLI completely separated from sync-daemon imports, no zombie processes

**Real-Time Sync Issue Identified (August 2025)**:
- ‚ùå **Sync Not Working**: All latency tests timeout (>10s), proving real-time sync is broken
- ‚úÖ **Process Running**: Daemon starts properly, processes historical files during initial sync
- ‚ùå **File Monitoring Failed**: Watcher goes idle after startup, not detecting new JSONL changes
- üìä **Evidence**: Transaction log shows "watcher_ready" but no subsequent file processing events

**Next Phase Required: Core Sync Engine Debug**
- Infrastructure is solid, but core file monitoring/processing pipeline needs investigation
- Real-time sync completely non-functional despite proper daemon management
   
3. **Type Safety**: Multiple `any` types compromise TypeScript benefits
   - Audit all `any` usage in CLI, MCP server, and sync daemon
   - Define proper interfaces for server instances, config objects, promises
   
4. **Configuration Consolidation**: Environment variable handling scattered
   - Centralize config management in dedicated module
   - Consistent defaults and validation across all components
   - Single source of truth for paths, timeouts, and service settings

### Testing Redesigned - Real Validation Focus (December 2024)
- **‚úÖ Test Philosophy Changed**: Now testing real conversation sync, not synthetic data
- **‚úÖ Real Validation Tests**: 5 new test scripts using actual Claude Code files
- **‚úÖ Status Command Fixed**: Simple output without 80k+ line log generation
- **‚úÖ Performance Metrics**: Measuring actual JSONL ‚Üí DB latency on real files

### Critical Issues Resolved
- **Synthetic Test Problem**: Original tests created artificial flow disconnected from reality
- **Status Command Failure**: Fixed massive log generation issue
- **Real Data Validation**: Tests now use actual `~/.claude/projects/` conversations
- **User Value Focus**: Success means real conversations are accessible

### ‚úÖ Real Test Execution Complete - Critical Issue Identified (August 8, 2025)

**Test Results Summary:**
- ‚úÖ **MCP Queries**: All tools working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Database Connectivity**: 66,348 messages, 449 sessions (historical data intact)
- ‚úÖ **Real File Detection**: 483 actual Claude Code conversation files found
- ‚ùå **Recent Sync Failure**: 0% sync rate on current conversation files
- ‚ùå **Sync Daemon Issue**: Not processing new files despite running

**Key Discovery**: Historical sync worked (66k+ messages in database) but **real-time sync has stopped working**. Recent conversations aren't being processed while daemon appears active.

**Next Priority**: Debug why sync daemon stopped processing recent Claude Code conversations while maintaining historical data access.

**Test Commands:**
- `npm test` - Run real validation suite ‚úÖ WORKING
- `npm run test:status` - Quick health check ‚úÖ WORKING
- `npm run test:latency` - Measure actual sync performance
- `npm run test:integrity` - Validate data accuracy

The foundation is rebuilt with proper real-world validation approach.


### üî¥ Critical Infrastructure Analysis: Zombie Sync Daemon (December 2024)

**Contradictory Status Indicators Discovered:**
1. Test Status: "Sync Daemon: NOT RUNNING"
2. CLI Start: "Error: Sync daemon is already running"  
3. Process Check: "Sync daemon process: FOUND"

**Diagnosis**: Sync daemon in zombie state - process exists but not functional

**Infrastructure Failures Identified:**
- `npm run status`: Produces 80k+ lines of logs (broken)
- `npm run test:status`: Works correctly with clean output
- `npm run dev:sync`: References non-existent daemon.ts file
- `npm start`: Can't start due to false "already running" detection

**Functional State Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Historical sync worked: 66,396+ messages prove past success
- ‚úÖ File detection works: 483 conversation files found
- ‚úÖ Database functional: 16.5MB, proper schema
- ‚úÖ MCP Server works: All 8 tools operational
- ‚ùå Real-time sync broken: 0% processing of recent files
- ‚ùå Process management broken: Can't cleanly stop/start

**Root Cause**: Not a sync algorithm problem - it's an operational infrastructure failure. The sync daemon achieved historical success but is stuck in broken state with no recovery mechanism.

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Kill zombie process manually
2. Fix CLI command references in package.json
3. Implement proper process management
4. Add zombie detection and auto-recovery
5. Unify status reporting systems

See `zombie-state-analysis.md` for detailed analysis.
