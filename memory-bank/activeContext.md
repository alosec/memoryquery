# Active Context

## Current Status: Sync Daemon First Pass Complete, Testing Phase Next âœ¨

The simple-memory-mcp project has successfully implemented both the complete MCP server AND the first working version of the sync daemon following proven cafe-db-sync patterns. The sync daemon is processing JSONL files and successfully populating the database. Next phase focuses on comprehensive testing and refinement.

## Project Genesis (August 8, 2025)

### Why Start Fresh?
- **Technical Debt Elimination**: Previous repositories had accumulated complexity and pipeline overhead
- **Unified Architecture**: MCP tools and sync daemon should be one coherent package
- **Clean Git History**: Cannot import messy history from existing repositories
- **Focused Scope**: Build exactly what's needed without extra complexity

### Core Vision
**One-Command Install:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.simple-memory.com | bash
# âœ… MCP server installed and registered
# âœ… Sync daemon configured and running
# âœ… All services coordinated
# âœ… Ready to use immediately
```

## Current Focus: Foundation Architecture (August 8, 2025)

### Project Structure Established
```

â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mcp-server/     # Conversation history MCP tools
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sync-daemon/    # Real-time JSONL â†’ SQLite sync
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cli/           # Service management commands

```

### Design Principles
1. **Installation-Centric**: User experience starts with install, everything flows from there
2. **Service Coordination**: Components designed to work together, not separately
3. **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized code without legacy complexity
4. **Zero Technical Debt**: Fresh start with modern best practices
5. **Focused Functionality**: Build what's needed, skip unnecessary features

## Active Development Goals

### âœ… Completed Milestones (August 8, 2025)
1. **âœ… Foundation Setup**: Complete memory bank and project structure established
2. **âœ… MCP Server**: All 8 tools implemented with modular architecture
3. **âœ… Package Definition**: Working package.json with dependencies and build system
4. **âœ… CLI Interface**: Service management commands functional

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic North Star: Memory MCP Server Focus

### Clear Mission Scope
**Primary Goal**: Create a robust, production-ready MCP server for Claude Code conversation history access. The sync daemon integration is specifically scoped to **support the MCP server functionality** - not as a general-purpose sync system.

**Strategic Focus**:
- **MCP Server**: The core product - conversation history access via MCP protocol
- **Sync Daemon**: Supporting component to ensure MCP server has real-time data access
- **Unified Package**: Install and manage both as coherent system focused on memory access

**Not in Scope**: General sync engines, complex multi-database systems, or pipeline transformations beyond what's needed for MCP functionality.

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Development Focus (August 8, 2025)
1. **âœ… Sync Daemon First Pass**: Complete Watch-Transform-Execute pipeline implemented following cafe-db-sync patterns
2. **ðŸ”„ Unit Testing Phase**: Write comprehensive tests for each component (parser, transformer, database, watcher)
3. **ðŸ”„ Integration Testing**: Test end-to-end sync daemon + MCP server coordination
4. **ðŸ“‹ Next: Installation Script**: Setup automation prioritizing MCP registration and functionality

**Immediate Priority**: Unit tests for sync daemon components to ensure reliability before production deployment.

### Integration Strategy for Sync Daemon
- **Purpose**: Ensure MCP server has fresh conversation data from Claude Code JSONL files
- **Scope**: Parse Claude Code format, update database, maintain sync health
- **Integration**: Coordinate as supporting service, not equal-priority component
- **Success Metric**: MCP tools return current conversation data without manual intervention

### Reference Implementation Strategy
- **Study Working Sync**: Extract core sync logic from `/home/alex/code/cafe/cafe-db-sync` (without importing technical debt)
- **Enhance MCP Tools**: Build on proven MCP server patterns from `claude-code-memory-mcp`
- **Modern Packaging**: Apply current software packaging practices from scratch

## Success Metrics

### âœ… Achieved
- **âœ… Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable modular architecture implemented
- **âœ… Development Experience**: TypeScript build, CLI interface, proper package structure
- **âœ… MCP Functionality**: All 8 tools working with enhanced features
- **âœ… Architecture Foundation**: Clean separation enabling easy sync daemon integration

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Targets
- **Install Experience**: Single command creates fully working system  
- **Service Reliability**: Both MCP and sync work together without manual intervention
- **User Adoption**: Package that developers actually want to install and use
- **Cross-Tool Support**: Cline and Claude Desktop integration

## Development Philosophy
**"Build it Right from Day 1"**: This project prioritizes doing things properly over speed. The goal is a solid package that represents the Claude Code memory tools ecosystem well.

Every architectural decision should be made through the lens of: "Is this the right way to solve this problem?"
