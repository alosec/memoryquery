# Current Development Status

## Project Phase: Testing Redesigned - Real Validation ✅
**Date**: December 2024

## What's Been Built

### Core Components (Implemented)
- **MCP Server** ✅ - All 8 conversation query tools functional
- **Sync Daemon** ✅ - Complete Watch-Transform-Execute pipeline
- **CLI Interface** ✅ - Service management commands working
- **Build System** ✅ - TypeScript compilation to CommonJS

### Testing Infrastructure (Redesigned)
- **Real Validation Tests** ✅ - 5 test scripts using actual conversation files
- **Status Command Fixed** ✅ - No longer generates 80k+ lines of logs
- **Performance Metrics** ✅ - Measures real JSONL → DB latency
- **Data Integrity Tests** ✅ - Validates source matches database

## Critical Change: Real vs Synthetic Testing

### Original Approach (Flawed)
- Created artificial test-1234.jsonl files
- Validated synthetic data processing
- Disconnected from actual user workflows
- Passing tests didn't guarantee real functionality

### New Approach (Correct)
- Uses real Claude Code conversation files
- Validates actual sync daemon behavior
- Measures real performance metrics
- Success means users can access their data

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Phase 1: Test Execution & Validation (Immediate Priority)
**Status**: Not started - Outside current session scope

1. **Run the test suite** with sync daemon active
2. **Document failures** and identify root causes
3. **Validate test quality** - Do they detect real issues?
4. **Fix discovered bugs** based on test results

### Phase 2: Technical Debt Resolution
**Status**: Identified, awaiting test results

1. **Hardcoded paths** - Replace with config management
2. **Type safety** - Eliminate `any` types
3. **Configuration** - Centralize environment variables
4. **TODOs** - Track and resolve

### Phase 3: Installation System
**Status**: Not started

1. **Install script** - Automated setup
2. **MCP registration** - Claude Code integration
3. **Service management** - systemd/launchd setup

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
**Status**: Pending test results

1. **Performance optimization** based on latency tests
2. **Error recovery** improvements
3. **Documentation** completion
4. **Release preparation**

## Key Metrics to Validate

### Core Functionality
- [ ] JSONL files sync to database reliably
- [ ] MCP tools return accurate data
- [ ] Services coordinate properly

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Sync latency P50 < 500ms
- [ ] Sync latency P95 < 2000ms
- [ ] Memory usage < 50MB per service
- [ ] CPU usage < 5% when idle

### Data Integrity
- [ ] No duplicate messages
- [ ] Transactions are atomic
- [ ] Tool uses linked correctly

## Current Blockers

None - Ready for test execution phase

## Risk Areas

1. **Unknown sync daemon bugs** - Tests will reveal
2. **MCP protocol issues** - Need real execution verification
3. **Performance bottlenecks** - Latency tests will identify
4. **Configuration conflicts** - Multiple DB path references

## Developer Notes

The project has reached a critical milestone with test implementation complete. The next session should focus on:

1. Starting sync daemon (`npm run dev:sync`)
2. Running test suite (`npm test`)
3. Analyzing results
4. Creating fix priority list
5. Iterating on most critical issues

The tests are designed to be run repeatedly during development to verify fixes and catch regressions.

## Success Criteria for Next Phase

✅ Tests execute successfully (infrastructure works)
✅ Failing tests clearly indicate what's broken
✅ Debug output helps identify root causes
✅ At least core functionality tests pass
✅ Performance baselines established

Once testing reveals the actual state of the system, we can move forward with confidence toward production readiness.
