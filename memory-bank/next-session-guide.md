# Next Session Quick Start

## Where We Left Off
- ✅ Test suite implementation complete (8 test scripts)
- ✅ All tests are non-interactive and LLM-friendly
- ⏸️ Tests have NOT been run yet
- 🎯 Next step: Execute tests and fix issues

## Immediate Commands to Run

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start sync daemon
cd /home/alex/code/simple-memory-mcp
npm run dev:sync

# Terminal 2: Build project if needed
npm run build

# Terminal 3: Run tests
npm test

# Or run specific tests
npm run test:latency    # Check performance
npm run test:sync       # Verify sync works
npm run test:mcp        # Test MCP tools
```

## Expected Test Outcomes

### If Everything Works:
```
✓ Sync Pipeline
✓ MCP Queries  
✓ Sync Latency (P50: <500ms, P95: <2000ms)
✓ Deduplication
✓ Transaction Atomicity
✓ Malformed JSONL
✓ Large File Processing

✓ All tests passed! 🎉
```

### More Likely - Some Failures:
- Sync daemon might not be configured correctly
- Database paths might be wrong
- MCP server stdio protocol might have issues
- Timing dependencies might be off

## Priority Fix Order

1. **Get sync pipeline working** - Most critical
2. **Fix MCP queries** - Core functionality
3. **Tune latency** - Performance baseline
4. **Address data integrity** - Deduplication/atomicity
5. **Handle errors** - Malformed input resilience

## Debugging Tips

### If sync isn't working:
- Check database path: `echo $SIMPLE_MEMORY_DB_PATH`
- Verify JSONL path: `ls ~/.claude/projects/test/`
- Check sync daemon logs: `npm run logs`

### If MCP fails:
- Ensure built: `npm run build`
- Check MCP server starts: `node dist/mcp-server/index.js`
- Verify stdio protocol format

### If latency is high:
- Check database indexes
- Monitor CPU/memory during test
- Look for lock contention

## Quick Validation Checklist

- [ ] Sync daemon starts without errors
- [ ] Test files can write to ~/.claude/projects/test/
- [ ] Database is accessible at configured path
- [ ] At least one test passes
- [ ] Latency measurements are reasonable
- [ ] No crashes during test execution

## Notes for Next Session

1. **Don't trust the tests yet** - They need validation through execution
2. **Expect timing issues** - May need to adjust sleep/wait times
3. **Check assumptions** - Database schema, file paths, etc.
4. **Iterate quickly** - Fix obvious issues first
5. **Document findings** - Update memory-bank with results

## Success Looks Like

By end of next session:
- Core tests passing (sync, MCP, latency)
- Performance baseline established
- List of bugs prioritized
- Clear path to stability

Remember: The tests are the map, but running them is the journey to discover what actually works!
